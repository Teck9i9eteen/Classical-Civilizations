    <h1>The Roman Republic</h1>
    
    <h2>Human and Physical Geography</h2>
    
    <p>During the Pax Romana (the peace which existed between nationalities within the Roman Empire), the rich and the wealthy (upper class) built huge, lavishly decorated houses as the peasents (lower class) tended to their every need. The average person (middle class) worked hard and well and lived in a very modest and average home. The romans had a diet revolving around grapes, grain, and olives. The rich and the wealthy were able to eat whatever they wanted, from jellyfish to peacock to ostrich and fungus. The more unusual the food seemed, the more they would want to eat it. They would also purge themselves to continue to eat. There was a myth about a place called the Vomitorium. It is said that the Vomitorium was a room where the rich would vomit their lavish meals to go eat whatever was left on the table. The poor, however, mainly ate bread and porridge, and met their protien needs by eating some kind of meat (usually pork) and Cheese.</p>
    
    <h2>Import/Export in the Roman Republic</h2>
    
    <p>There were many things that Rome had, such as olive oil and wine. But they also didnt have some of the more essential things. Rome would export Cereals, wint and olive oil and in return, they gained much from the import. They gained things such as:

    <ul>
        <li>Precious Metals</li>
        <li>Marble</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>
    There were many things that they were able to gain. They were also (in the rare circumstance) gaining plenty of gold, about 9,000 Kilos per year in southern spain. They made some good profit during the times of trade. (*Note: 9,000 Kilos = 19841.6 pounds*)
    </p>
    
    <h2>Government Style</h2>
    
    <p>The Roman Republic was mainly a Aristocracy. Meaning, the Roman Republic was run by the rich and the wealthy. The word, translated from Greek, means, "Rule of the best-born". I.O.W, the upper class was the dominant people in the Roman Republic. If you were in the middle class or lower class, you were subject to being the upper class's slaves.</p>
    
    <h2>Religioius Beliefs</h2>
    
    <p>The religion of the Roman Republic was manly polytheistic.This meant that they believed in more than just one god. Since they were greek, they believed in the greek gods and goddess's, such as Zeus, God of thunder and sky, Hades, God of the underworld, Posiden, God of the sea, and Aphrodite, Goddess of Love, Beauty, and Eternal Youth. They believed in the greek gods, that is until they were overthrown by Chrisianity.</p>
    
    <h2>Contributions</h2>
    
    <p>The Roman Republic had many contributions, such as the ways of thinking, and the ways of well-being. The Roman Republic created the alphabet, helping us standardise text and communicate more easily. This then led up to the Newspaper, which helped share the news and the details about the upcoming events.</p>
